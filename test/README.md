# Testing signalrcore lib

## Pre testing

For testing this python lib since version 0.7.6 you will need docker,
i will upload dotnet code with signalr chat, chat auth, streaming and a dockerfile
to build it with a bash script to previously set up the environment. :D 

Signalr dotnet code from [here](https://codeload.github.com/aspnet/Docs/zip/master) or download my test serv from [here](https://github.com/mandrewcito/signalrcore-containertestservers).,
